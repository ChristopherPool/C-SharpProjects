# C-SharpProjects
Some C# assessments I did when I was first learning C#.

* GnomeSort - A Windows Forms Application that sorts a list of random numbers by using the Gnome Sort algorithm. The program uses an Array of 28 integers. After each iteration the program displays the Array eventually sorting throm smallest to largest integers. 

* FireDangerRating - Console Application that reads the Fire Danger Rating (integer input) and then displays the Fire Danger Category as a message with the corresponding colour and text which is completed using case statements. 

* BikeCollection - A Windows Forms Application which allows a person to keep track of their Classic Bike collection. The program allows the user to enter the make, model, engine size, year and cost of their bikes. The collection is sorted alphabetically using the model name, ascending. The user can add bikes to their collection with the data stored in a text file, to search for a specific bike in their collection by typing the model name, save the data to a text file, update a selected bike with new information, delete a bike from their records and reset their collection. 

## Smaller Projects
* SmallToLarge - Console Application that reads from the console a series of three integers and displays the smallest and largest of them
* IntroToIteration - Console Application that will display all the numbers from 19 down to 7 inclusively. After each iteration (loop) the program displays the number.
* IntegerDivisor - Console Application that will loop through a series of numbers and divide each one with a Divisor. If the division has no remainder then display the value
