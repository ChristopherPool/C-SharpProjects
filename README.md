# C-SharpProjects
Some C# assessments I did when I was first learning C#.

* GnomeSort - Windows Forms Application that sorts a list of random numbers by using the Gnome Sort algorithm. The program uses an Array of 28 integers. After each iteration the program displays the Array eventually sorting throm smallest to largest integers. 

* FireDangerRating - Console Application that reads the Fire Danger Rating (integer input) and then displays the Fire Danger Category as a message with the corresponding colour and text which is completed using case statements.
